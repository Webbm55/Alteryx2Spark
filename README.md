# Alteryx to Spark Converter or to any language

Sample Alteryx Worfklow

If you are working with large datasets and looking for ways to scale up your data processing, then converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code can be an effective solution. However, the process of converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code can be time-consuming and require a significant amount of technical expertise. This is where an Alteryx to Spark code converter can come in handy.

In this blog, we will discuss an Alteryx to Spark code converter, its benefits, and how it can make the process of converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code easier and more efficient.

What is an Alteryx to Spark code converter?

An Alteryx to Spark code converter is a tool that automatically converts Alteryx workflows to Spark code. It takes an Alteryx workflow as input and generates a Spark program that replicates the workflow. The tool can save time and reduce the technical expertise required to convert Alteryx workflows to Spark code.

Benefits of using an Alteryx to Spark code converter

    Saves time Converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code manually can be a time-consuming task, especially if the workflow is complex. An Alteryx to Spark code converter can automate the process and generate Spark code in a fraction of the time it would take to do it manually.
    Reduces technical expertise required Converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code requires technical expertise in both Alteryx and Spark. An Alteryx to Spark code converter can reduce the technical expertise required by automating the process of converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code.
    Improves accuracy Manual conversion of Alteryx workflows to Spark code can be prone to errors. An Alteryx to Spark code converter can improve the accuracy of the conversion by automating the process and reducing the risk of human errors.
    Supports scalability An Alteryx to Spark code converter can help in scaling up data processing by converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code. Spark is designed to handle large datasets and can distribute the processing load across multiple nodes, making it an ideal choice for scalable data processing.

How an Alteryx to Spark code converter works

Firstly, the tool reads the metadata and connections of each transformation in your Alteryx workflow. Based on this information, it creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the flow of data between transformations. You can see this DAG in a PNG file, which will be similar to the Alteryx GUI but without any transformation names.

Next, the tool writes the Spark code by following this DAG. It starts by creating a Spark DataFrame that represents the input data for the first transformation in the workflow. Then, it maps each Alteryx transformation to a corresponding Spark operation, DataFrame API. It applies the necessary transformations to this DataFrame, one by one, until it reaches the end of the workflow. Finally, it writes the output DataFrame to a file or database.

One important thing to note is that the tool follows the DAG because, in order to execute the current DataFrame, it needs the previous transformation. For example, if the current transformation is a filter, it needs the DataFrame output from the previous transformation as its input. This ensures that the Spark code generated by the tool is correct and follows the same logic as your original Alteryx workflow.

In conclusion, our Alteryx to Spark code converter tool can save you a lot of time and effort when converting your Alteryx workflows to Spark code. It does this by reading the metadata and connections of each transformation, creating a DAG, and writing the Spark code by following this DAG. So, if youâ€™re looking for an easy way to convert your Alteryx workflows to Spark code, give this a try!
This is the dag which is looks similar to alteryx GUI but without the names. If you see here 4 and 8 are inputs and 29 and 27 are outputs.

Conclusion

Converting Alteryx workflows to Spark code can be a challenging task, especially for those who are not familiar with Spark. An Alteryx to Spark code converter can automate the process and make it easier and more efficient. It can save time, reduce technical expertise required, improve accuracy, and support scalability. If you are working with large datasets and looking for ways to scale up your data processing, then an Alteryx to Spark code converter can be an effective solution. I am still working on it, so there would be some manual efforts needed on few transformations on spark code and its not 100 % reliable ( >70% works), there are some corner scenarios which needs to be fixed as well.
