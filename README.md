# Alteryx2Spark or Alteryx to Any Migration Tool
This tool is designed to help users migrate existing Alteryx workflows to spark code and to any language or framework of their choice. The tool takes an Alteryx workflow as input, extracts the data processing logic, and generates spark code in the output file. For other languages like SQL, we need manual effort to write into sql code , but it would be easy since all the tranformation logics are captured in the output file.
